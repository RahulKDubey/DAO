**OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:**

**STEP 1:**  To use it, you must have Ganache installed in your system.

**STEP 2:**  Open Ganache, click on QUICKSTART.

**STEP 3:**  Then visit the site link (https://decen-autonomous-org.netlify.app/) and refresh it.

**STEP 4:**  The first account address, which is showing up, is the default Manager Address. Before he can create a proposal, different accounts need to contribute an amount in Wei, and as the accounts contribute, they become part of the Investor List. The amount contributed will be equal to the number of voting points got in return.

**STEP 5:**  Once the contributions are done, The Manager address can create a proposal, and it will be added to the proposal list having the data as follows (proposal id, amount needed, recipient address, votes got, proposal end time).

**STEP 6:**  Now the Investors can vote to the proposal through the id (Index Number 0,1,2 ....)

**STEP 7:**  If the proposal gets enough voting points, which is here default 51% of total voting points, then only the manager can execute the proposal.

**STEP 8:**  After execution, the recipient address will be added with the funds needed from DAO available funds.

**STEP 9:**  There are other functionalities also like transferring the share to another address, redeeming share.

**NOTE:** The funds that the Investors are contributing go to the DAO available funds, and from there, the proposal list address gets the needed fund if the majority (51%) of investors support/votes for it.
